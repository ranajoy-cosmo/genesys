# In this module I define the application wide settings for a particular machine.
# This particular case is made for the owl25-owl-28 nodes at ITA
# The settings are stored as human readable text in the yaml format
# 1) global_system: Contains the settings and information about the host system
# 2) global_paths: Contains the paths and links to important directories on the host system

global_system:
    host_name: ita_owl_fat # The hostname of the system the app is running on
    num_sockets_per_node: 4 # The number of sockets per node of the system
    num_cores_per_socket: 18 # The number of cores(processors) per socket of the machine
    num_threads_per_core: 2 # The maximum number of threads per core
    memory_per_node: 1536 # The memory in GigaBytes per node of the machine

global_paths:
    storage_dir: /mn/stornext/d14/comap/ranajoyb/Genesys_Files # The directory where large files are written down. For example the scratch system at NERSC. Please do not set this somewhere with very limited storage as it'll fill up fast. Ideally it should have space of the order of a few TeraBytes.
    # The following directories are the locations relative to storage_dir. Softlinks to these will be generated for easy access of the content of these directories.
    real_output_dir: output # The directory for I/O during execution and storing simulation data.
    real_maps_dir: maps # The directory under the data directory where the input maps are stored.
    real_spectra_dir: spectra # The directory under the data directory where the CMB spectra are stored.
    real_data_dir: data # The directory under the data directory where the CMB spectra are stored.
