The executable for generating simulated Time Ordered Data (TOD) is sim_timestream.py

The module is called as follows:
python sim_timestream.py <run_type> <config_file>
The path to the config_file is provided in a dot-separated format. For example genesys.timestream_simulation.config_files.my_config.py

For serial execution:
python sim_timestream.py serial <config_file>

For mpi execution:
mpiexec -n <NUM_PROCESSES> python sim_timestream.py mpi <config_file>
OR
mpirun -n <NUM_PROCESSES> python sim_timestream.py mpi <config_file>

where <NUM_PROCESSES> is the number of mpi processes to be run simultaneously

mpirun or mpiexec may be changed for whatever is used on the particular system to execute mpi jobs
