The executable for generating simulated Time Ordered Data (TOD) is sim_tod.py

The module is called as follows:
python sim_tod.py <config_file> <run_type> <verbosity>
The path to the config_file is provided relative to the tod directory.

For serial execution:
python sim_timestream.py <config_file> serial <verbosity>

For mpi execution:
mpiexec -n <NUM_PROCESSES> python sim_tod.py <config_file> mpi <verbosity>
OR
mpirun -n <NUM_PROCESSES> python sim_tod.py <config_file> mpi <verbosity>

where <NUM_PROCESSES> is the number of mpi processes to be run simultaneously

mpirun or mpiexec may be changed for whatever is used on the particular system to execute mpi jobs
